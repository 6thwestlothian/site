  Squirrels can achieve anything they set their minds to – and they have lots of fun along the way!
  Our Squirrel Drey is for young people aged 4 to 6 to take their first step into being part of Scouts, 
  and they’ll help everyone get ready for the adventure of school too. Sessions will be packed with
  outdoors activities, fun, games, badges, laughter, and so much more to help our youngest members learn
  the skills they need for life.
