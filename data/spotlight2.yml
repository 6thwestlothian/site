  Our Beaver Colony is for young people aged 6 to 8 who are growing up and learning in small but mighty ways. 
  Whether they're exploring the great outdoors or trying new activities, the most important skills our 
  Beavers learn are the ones that will make them feel super strong standing on their own two feet. We call 
  these character skills. They include things like integrity – which means being honest and doing what you 
  think is right – and initiative – which means knowing how to take the lead on something without being asked. It’s all about having the courage to try new things and learn from them.
