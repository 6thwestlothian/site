  Our Cub Pack is for young people aged 8 to 10½ and is all about adventure, learning, and teamwork. 
  Cubs explore the outdoors, make new friends, and try exciting activities, like lighting fires and going 
  on night hikes. Along the way, they pick up practical skills such as cooking and first aid, while 
  developing important qualities like confidence, teamwork, and leadership. It’s not just about what 
  they can do now — it’s about helping them grow into the best versions of themselves, ready to make a 
  positive impact in their communities and beyond.
