  Scouts is all about taking on bigger challenges and discovering new adventures. Our Scout Troop is for
  young people aged 10½ to 14 and they spend time outdoors, camping, hiking, or learning survival skills. 
  They push themselves to try new things, from rock climbing to canoeing, while building confidence and 
  resilience. Along the way, Scouts develop leadership skills and learn to solve problems as a team. It’s 
  about gaining practical skills for life and building character traits like integrity and determination, 
  all while having fun and making lasting friendships. Scouts are prepared for anything, ready to make
  a difference in their communities and the world.
