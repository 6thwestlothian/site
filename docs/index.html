        <p>Squirrels can achieve anything they set their minds to – and they have lots of fun along the way! Our Squirrel Drey is for young people aged 4 to 6 to take their first step into being part of Scouts, and they’ll help everyone get ready for the adventure of school too. Sessions will be packed with outdoors activities, fun, games, badges, laughter, and so much more to help our youngest members learn the skills they need for life.</p>

        <p>Our Beaver Colony is for young people aged 6 to 8 who are growing up and learning in small but mighty ways. Whether they're exploring the great outdoors or trying new activities, the most important skills our Beavers learn are the ones that will make them feel super strong standing on their own two feet. We call these character skills. They include things like integrity – which means being honest and doing what you think is right – and initiative – which means knowing how to take the lead on something without being asked. It’s all about having the courage to try new things and learn from them.</p>

        <p>Our Cub Pack is for young people aged 8 to 10½ and is all about adventure, learning, and teamwork. Cubs explore the outdoors, make new friends, and try exciting activities, like lighting fires and going on night hikes. Along the way, they pick up practical skills such as cooking and first aid, while developing important qualities like confidence, teamwork, and leadership. It’s not just about what they can do now — it’s about helping them grow into the best versions of themselves, ready to make a positive impact in their communities and beyond.</p>

        <p>Scouts is all about taking on bigger challenges and discovering new adventures. Our Scout Troop is for young people aged 10½ to 14 and they spend time outdoors, camping, hiking, or learning survival skills. They push themselves to try new things, from rock climbing to canoeing, while building confidence and resilience. Along the way, Scouts develop leadership skills and learn to solve problems as a team. It’s about gaining practical skills for life and building character traits like integrity and determination, all while having fun and making lasting friendships. Scouts are prepared for anything, ready to make a difference in their communities and the world.</p>

                                    and Fundraisers who work behind the scenes, ensuring that we operate in the way
                                    we're supposed to, and to ensure we have the financial backing to continue
                                    to provide opportunities for young people that are affordable for
                                    all families.

                                    Volunteering can be a brilliant way to boost your mental wellbeing. It’s a

                                    might even learn a bit about yourself along the way!

                                    can spare. Whatever your background, identity or ability, there’s a volunteer 
                                    spot with your name on it!</p>
